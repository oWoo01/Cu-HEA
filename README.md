# FeNiCrCoCu High-Entropy Alloy (HEA) Simulations

This repository contains simulation scripts and theoretical analysis scripts done during my study of the FeNiCrCoCu high-entropy alloy (HEA). The work is organized into several research directions, each represented by a folder.

## Structure

- `Curtin's theory/`: Based on Curtin’s strengthening theory in HEA (2016).
- `atomic misfit feature/`: Analysis of local atomic misfit size, misfit shear modulus and misfit bulk modulus.
- `atomic pinning strength/`: Quantification of atomic pinning strength according to F.Shuang (2025).
- `gamma surface/`: γ-surface calculations.
- `glide/`: Dislocation glide simulations and velocity analysis.
- `pinning time/`: Study of pinning time for dislocations and its statistical characterization.

## Goal

The goal of this project is to investigate the plastic deformation mechanisms in FeNiCrCoCu HEA at the atomic scale, with a focus on:

- Dislocation–solute interaction
- Strengthening mechanisms

## Notes

- All simulations are performed using LAMMPS.
- Analysis scripts are written in Python or Bash.
- Data may be stored as raw outputs (`.dump`, `.txt`) or processed plots.
